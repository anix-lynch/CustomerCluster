## 🌐 Project Overview

Customer segmentation groups customers based on similarities in behaviors or preferences, enabling businesses to move away from one-size-fits-all approaches. In this project, we’ll use the K-Means algorithm on the Online Retail dataset to identify distinct customer segments. We’ll preprocess the data, build the clustering model, and visualize the segments in an interactive 3D graph.
